## Hi,
I am a graduate student (Leiden University) and researcher (ANU). I am interested in international security, and the multi-level governance of the internet, climate change and corporations. My programs mainly focus on solving problems in open source intelligence and computational social science. In short, I analyze online activity and large datasets to make sense of policy and (inter)national security issues.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Opinion mining for refugee and human rights issues using news and social media data
- Analyzing the outcomes of the UN Universal Periodic Review on human rights treaty ratification
- Tools to armed conflict, regulatory and policy issues at scale 

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Building and managing cloud and remote development enviornments
- High performance computation
- Integrating large language models into data science and analytics pipelines
