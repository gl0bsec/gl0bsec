## Hi.
I am a masters student and researcher interested in international security, and the multi-level governance of the internet, climate change and corporations. Here you'll find programs ive developed to solve problems in open source intelligence (OSINT) and computational social science. In short, I analyse online activity and large datasets to make sense of policy and security issues.

### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
- Opinion mining for refugee and human rights issues using news and social media data
- Analyzing the outcomes of the UN Universal Periodic Review on human rights treaty ratification
- Tools to make sense of armed conflict, regulatory and policy issues at scale 

### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
- Building and managing cloud and remote development enviornments
- High performance computation
- Integrating large language models into data science and analytics pipelines
